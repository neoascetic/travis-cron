===========

Run your  travis builds periodically  with cron, at least  until [corresponding
issue][travis-issue] is fixed.

Self-hosted replacement  for [traviscron][], which  seems to be broken  at this
moment, and also much simplier replacement for [travis_cron][]. It is less than
20 lines of  bash within one file, so  look at the code, it is  better than any
docs!
